# Covid-19-Impacts-Analysis-on-the-Global-Economy
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, reliable and accessible information is essential for
guiding public health efforts and individual decision-making. This project report presents an
initiative aimed at addressing this need by providing a robust visualization of COVID-19 data.
Through the utilization of web scraping techniques and data visualization tools, we aim to offer
a comprehensive snapshot of the pandemic's status, focusing on the previous day's statistics.
The primary objective of this project is to empower individuals with the knowledge
they need to navigate the pandemic effectively. By presenting COVID-19 data in a visually
engaging and easily understandable format, we aim to promote informed awareness and
encourage proactive measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.
The crisis had a dramatic impact on global poverty and inequality. Global poverty
increased for the first time in a generation, and disproportionate income losses among
disadvantaged populations led to a dramatic rise in inequality within and across countries.
The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a lot of restrictions which resulted in so many
impacts on the global economy. Almost all countries were impacted negatively by the rise in
the cases of COVID-19.
This project report outlines the methodology employed, key features of the
visualization tool, and its potential impact on raising awareness and facilitating informed
decision-making. Additionally, it underscores the collaborative nature of the project, inviting
suggestions and contributions from users to enhance the range and effectiveness of the
visualizations presented.
In conclusion, this project represents a concerted effort to provide timely and relevant
information on COVID-19, leveraging technology to empower individuals and communities in
the fight against the pandemic. By fostering a deeper understanding of the data and its
implications, we aim to unite efforts towards minimizing the impact of the virus and building
a healthier, more resilient society.
